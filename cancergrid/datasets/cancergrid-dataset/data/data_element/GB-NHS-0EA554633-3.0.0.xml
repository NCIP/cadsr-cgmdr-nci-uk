            <cgMDR:definition_text>This is the code of the GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONER (GMP) with whom the PATIENT is registered. A doctor receives a GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL (GMC) CODE on qualification. If he/she
                        then chooses to enter general practice, a further number is allocated (the
                            DOCTOR INDEX NUMBER (DIN)) by the Information Centre for
                        health and social care (IC). This number is passed to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) requesting the number who then liaise
                        with the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) Prescription Pricing Division
                        (PPD) on the issue of prescription pads etc. The NHS BSA PPD use the number
                        to derive the GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONER GMP (PPD) CODE by prefixing it
                        with the character 'G' and adding a check digit at the end. The GMP code
                        linked to his/her main practice is included on the National Administrative
                        Codes Service (NACS) CD-ROM and the NACS NHSnet website.The GMP code is an eight character alphanumeric code, see PERSON IDENTIFIER and GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONER GMP (PPD)
                        CODE.When a locum refers, use the code of the GP for whom the locum is acting. See
                        GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONER GMP (PPD) CODE.For GPs working in hospitals, the following codes should be used:-if the GP is working as an assistant, use
                                the code of the responsible consultant;-if the GP is working as a consultant, use
                                the GP's GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL (GMC) CODE.Whilst both Ministry of Defence (MoD) and prison doctors provide general
                        medical services to their communities, they are not GMPs and should not be
                        recorded as Registered GMPs. They can refer (REFERRER CODE).For the NACS contact details, see Contact Details.</cgMDR:definition_text>
