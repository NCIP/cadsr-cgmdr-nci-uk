    <cgMDR:datatype_description>gYearMonth represents a specific gregorian month in a specific
      gregorian year. The ·value space· of gYearMonth is the set of Gregorian calendar months as
      defined in § 5.2.1 of [ISO 8601]. Specifically, it is a set of one-month long, non-periodic
      instances e.g. 1999-10 to represent the whole month of 1999-10, independent of how many days
      this month has. Since the lexical representation allows an optional time zone indicator,
      gYearMonth values are partially ordered because it may not be possible to unequivocally
      determine the order of two values one of which has a time zone and the other does not. If
      gYearMonth values are considered as periods of time, the order relation on gYearMonth values
      is the order relation on their starting instants. This is discussed in Order relation on
      dateTime (§3.2.7.4). See also Adding durations to dateTimes (§E). Pairs of gYearMonth values
      with or without time zone indicators are totally ordered.</cgMDR:datatype_description>
