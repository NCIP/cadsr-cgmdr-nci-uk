    <cgMDR:datatype_description>
        <p>dateTime values may be viewed as objects with integer-valued year, month, day, hour and
         minute properties, a decimal-valued second property, and a boolean timezoned property. Each
         such object also has one decimal-valued method or computed property, timeOnTimeline, whose
         value is always a decimal number; the values are dimensioned in seconds, the integer 0 is
         0001-01-01T00:00:00 and the value of timeOnTimeline for other dateTime values is computed
         using the Gregorian algorithm as modified for leap-seconds. The timeOnTimeline values form
         two related "timelines", one for timezoned values and one for non-timezoned values. Each
         timeline is a copy of the ·value space· of decimal, with integers given units of seconds.</p>
        <p>The ·value space· of dateTime is closely related to the dates and times described in ISO
         8601. For clarity, the text above specifies a particular origin point for the timeline. It
         should be noted, however, that schema processors need not expose the timeOnTimeline value
         to schema users, and there is no requirement that a timeline-based implementation use the
         particular origin described here in its internal representation. Other interpretations of
         the ·value space· which lead to the same results (i.e., are isomorphic) are of course
         acceptable.</p>
        <p>All timezoned times are Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, sometimes called "Greenwich Mean
         Time"). Other timezones indicated in lexical representations are converted to UTC during
         conversion of literals to values. "Local" or untimezoned times are presumed to be the time
         in the timezone of some unspecified locality as prescribed by the appropriate legal
         authority; currently there are no legally prescribed timezones which are durations whose
         magnitude is greater than 14 hours. The value of each numeric-valued property (other than
         timeOnTimeline) is limited to the maximum value within the interval determined by the
         next-higher property. For example, the day value can never be 32, and cannot even be 29 for
         month 02 and year 2002 (February 2002).</p>
