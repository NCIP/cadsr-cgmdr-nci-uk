    <cgMDR:datatype_description>Decimal represents a subset of the real numbers, which can be represented by decimal numerals. The ·value space· of decimal is the set of numbers that can be obtained by multiplying an integer by a non-positive power of ten, i.e., expressible as i × 10^-n where i and n are integers and n &gt;= 0. Precision is not reflected in this value space; the number 2.0 is not distinct from the number 2.00. The ·order-relation· on decimal is the order relation on real numbers, restricted to this subset.</cgMDR:datatype_description>
