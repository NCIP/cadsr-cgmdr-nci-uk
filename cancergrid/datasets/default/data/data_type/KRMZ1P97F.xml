    <cgMDR:datatype_description>The string datatype represents character strings in XML. The ·value
      space· of string is the set of finite-length sequences of characters (as defined in [XML 1.0
      (Second Edition)]) that ·match· the Char production from [XML 1.0 (Second Edition)]. A
      character is an atomic unit of communication; it is not further specified except to note that
      every character has a corresponding Universal Character Set code point, which is an integer.</cgMDR:datatype_description>
